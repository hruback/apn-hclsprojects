# Comparing Machine Learning Classifiers using Breast Cancer dataset

This example notebook shows how to use Sagemaker to compare different Machine Learning models  to predict breast cancer. It demonstrates the following:
* Basic setup for using Sagemaker.
* Training Sagemaker's LogicalRegression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, Kernel CVM, RandomForest, and GaussianNB classifiers
* Printing the Confusion Matrix 
The evaluation is done against the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for the metrics of accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer data can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
