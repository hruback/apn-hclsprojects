**Design Pattern â€“ Reduce storage costs**

One of the main value propositions of Cloud is availability of 
cheap, durable storage that can grow with the needs of a business. 
Since Enterprise Imaging is very storage intensive as images need to be stored for several years 
to meet compliance requirements, ISVs can move the archival storage to Cloud to reduce the overall cost of a PACS solution. 
Figure  shows the logical architecture of such a design pattern. 
In this case, archival storage is moved to the Cloud.
